API Rate Limiting System

This is a tool for limiting the number of requests made to an API to prevent attacks such as DDoS attacks. It is written in Python and uses the Flask-Limiter library to enforce rate limiting rules based on the ISO standard.
Installation

    Install Python 3 and pip (if not already installed).

    Install Flask-Limiter library using pip:

    pip install Flask-Limiter

    Create a new Python file api.py and paste the code from this repository.

    Save and close the api.py file.

Usage

To start the API Rate Limiting System, simply run the following command in your terminal:

python api.py

This will start the Flask development server and make the API available at http://localhost:5000/.
Example

Here is an example of how to test the API using curl:

javascript

curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/ \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3"

Security

This tool is designed to provide an additional layer of security for APIs by limiting the number of requests made to them. It can be used in conjunction with other security measures such as authentication and encryption to create a robust security system.
